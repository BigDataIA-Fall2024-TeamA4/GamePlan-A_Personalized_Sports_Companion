# GamePlan-A_Personalized_Sports_Companion


## Project Overview

Gameplan: A Personalized Sports Companion is an innovative platform designed to offer users a tailored sports experience. The application allows users to register, select their sporting interests, and specify their expertise level, ensuring a highly personalized journey. Through advanced data processing techniques, the platform aggregates relevant sports news, real-time fixtures, and skill-building resources. A sophisticated search functionality powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system ensures users receive the most accurate and contextually relevant responses. With seamless integration of external data sources and real-time updates, users are provided with up-to-date fixtures and recommendations. The entire system is containerized for efficient deployment and scalability, making it a robust solution for sports enthusiasts seeking personalized content.

## Goal and Expected Outcome

**Goal:** The goal is to build a comprehensive, personalized sports companion application that helps users stay informed, improve their skills, and find local sports opportunities based on their interests and expertise. The application should provide a seamless experience with real-time sports news, fixtures, skill upgrade recommendations, and personalized user interactions. The key focus is on dynamic user engagement, sports news filtering, and relevant recommendations for skill enhancement.

**Final Outcome:**

- **Fully Functional FastAPI and Streamlit Application:** An interactive user interface built with Streamlit, where users can register, login, and manage their interests and expertise level.
A backend powered by FastAPI that handles authentication, sports news fetching, fixtures display, and skill upgrade recommendations.

- **Personalized Sports News Feed:** Personalized news articles fetched from multiple sources (BBC Sport, SkySports, Bleacher Report), filtered based on user interests, and displayed in a dynamic, user-friendly format.

- **Real-Time Sports Fixtures:** Integration with APIs for cricket, football, tennis, and basketball fixtures to provide up-to-date match schedules based on the userâ€™s sporting interests.

- **Skill Upgrade Recommendations:** A recommendation engine that suggests relevant YouTube tutorials and nearby sports facilities using user data (sporting interest and expertise level), powered by Langchain for the planning and execution agent.

- **Incremental Data Handling and Search Functionality:** Implementation of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for contextual querying, using Pinecone for fast search and response generation, enhanced with web search capabilities via the OpenAI and SERP API.

- **Cloud Deployment and Dockerization:** The entire application will be containerized using Docker, deployed on GCP Cloud, and made publicly accessible to users.

## Technologies Used

![BeautifulSoup](https://img.shields.io/badge/BeautifulSoup-FF4E00?logo=python&logoColor=white) : Used for web scraping, extracting articles from RSS feeds of BBC Sport, SkySports, and Bleacher Report.

![Airflow](https://img.shields.io/badge/Airflow-017E6B?logo=apache-airflow&logoColor=white) : Used for orchestrating and automating the scraping, data processing, and storage workflows.

![Amazon S3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Amazon%20S3-569A31?logo=amazonaws&logoColor=white) : Stores raw scraped data (articles) and other assets, providing scalable and durable storage.

![Pinecone](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pinecone-00B8D9?logo=pinecone&logoColor=white) : Stores vector embeddings of scraped articles to enable fast similarity searches in the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.

![OpenAI](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenAI-111111?logo=openai&logoColor=white) : Used for generating responses when a user query does not find relevant information in the fetched data, part of the RAG search process. Open AI model gpt-3.5-turbo used for categorization

![SERP API](https://img.shields.io/badge/SERP%20API-FF5722?logo=searchengineland&logoColor=white) : Used as a web search agent to retrieve additional data when the RAG search does not find relevant results.

![FastAPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/FastAPI-009688?logo=fastapi&logoColor=white) : Powers the backend API, handling user requests for sports news, fixtures, and skill recommendations.


![Streamlit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Streamlit-FF4B4B?logo=streamlit&logoColor=white) : Handles the frontend, displaying the UI for users to interact with sports news, fixtures, and skill upgrade recommendations.


![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2496ED?logo=docker&logoColor=white) : Containerised the application, ensuring a consistent and portable environment for deployment.

![GCP](https://img.shields.io/badge/GCP-4285F4?logo=google-cloud&logoColor=white) : Hosts the containerized application, providing scalable infrastructure for deployment and management.

![Snowflake](https://img.shields.io/badge/Snowflake-004F9C?logo=snowflake&logoColor=white) : Storing User Data

![HuggingFace](https://img.shields.io/badge/HuggingFace-FF2D20?logo=huggingface&logoColor=white) : SentenceTransformer("BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5") used for generating Embeddings
